# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Overview
The purpose of this exercise is to utilize JavaScript, Leaflet, and geoJSON to produce a map showing relational data between the world's tectonic plate locations and earthquakes. 

## Results
This map contains three different map styles (street, satellite, and dark) along with three overlays (All Earthquakes, Tectionic Plates, and Major Earthquakes) which can be toggled to show all overlays or just a single overlay.
